## 2.0.2 (2015-07-24)

Bugfixes:

  - Make sure we pass through the error, request, and Prerender response to afterRender

## 2.0.0 (2015-07-15)

Bugfixes:

  - Stop swallowing errors if the prerender service fails.

    Before: If the prerender service errors out (e.g., not available and the request times out), the error is swallowed and `next` called with no args.

    After: error is passed through to `next`, and `prerender.afterRenderFn` is handed `err` as the first arg. Makes it much easier to know if you're misconfiguring something or forgot to start the prerender server locally when testing.
